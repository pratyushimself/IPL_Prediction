# IPL Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using machine learning models. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Historical IPL match data, player statistics, and team performance data.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Model Building:** Using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
- **Prediction:** Deploying the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
